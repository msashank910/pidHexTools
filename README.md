# pidHexTools 🔍🔢

**pidHexTools** is a lightweight C++ utility for working with process ASLR offsets and hexadecimal calculations. It retrieves base addresses for a running process in Linux and optionally computes absolute addresses. Additionally, if no command-line arguments are provided, it enters interactive hex calculator mode for basic hex arithmetic.

⚙️ Requirements

    Operating System: Linux (x86-64 bit architecture)
    Compiler: g++ with C++20 support
    Permissions: Requires appropriate permissions to access /proc/<pid>/maps (typically run as root for system processes)


## 🛠 Features
- **Extracts ASLR offsets:** Retrieves the base address of a process using its PID.
- **Computes absolute addresses:** Optionally takes a second argument as a relative address and returns the absolute address.
- **Interactive Hex Calculator Mode** – If run without arguments, enters an interactive mode for hexadecimal arithmetic.
- **Command-line utility:** Simple to use via terminal commands.

🚀 Usage

Compile the program:

    make

Run via:

    ./pidHexTools <pid> [relative_hex_address]
or

    ./pidHexTools

Examples:

Extract the ASLR offset:

    ./pidHexTools 1234

Get absolute address from a relative address:

    ./pidHexTools 1234 0x400
